TwoSampleMR v0.4.18 (Release date: 2019-01-31)
==============

Changes:

* Fixed a bug in mr_heterogeneity that would have impacted a minority of cases. If the method list was being specified then the order of the results didn't always match the method (MR Egger and IVW were mixed up). This did not affect default usage.
* Added index of suspicion functionality, and penalised mode estimator
* Added transformation function to scale effect estimate units to SD scale
* Starting to write change log again!

TwoSampleMR v0.3.4 (Release date: 2017-11-30)
==============

Changes:

* Moving over to elastic search database so the request batching is changing from 50 SNPs per chunk to 10000. This can be modified through extract_outcome_data(splitsize=50)
* Changing harmonise_data behaviour - now does not discard the bad SNPs but retains them with the mr_keep column indicating whether or not they will be used by the mr analysis functions
* Fixed issue with oauth token
* Updated scatter plot to register the mr_keep column.


TwoSampleMR v0.3.3 (Release date: 2017-11-23)
==============

Changes:

* Fixed bug in singlesnp and leaveoneout analyses


TwoSampleMR v0.3.2 (Release date: 2017-11-22)
==============

Changes:

* Added function to check for latest version on package load


TwoSampleMR v0.3.1 (Release date: 2017-11-22)
==============

Changes:

* One of the external packages that TwoSampleMR depends upon had changed, making the authorisation behaviour change. The authorisation was timing out after an hour and it was not refreshing after its timeout. This has now been fixed - the authorisation token will refresh after an hour.

* The authorisation token used to be stored in a hidden file called .httr-oauth. This has now been changed - it will be stored in a visible file called 'mrbase.oauth'.

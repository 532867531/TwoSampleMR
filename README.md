# Two Sample MR


## Part 1
- Get effects for exposure and outcome relative to the same allele
- Get standard errors
- Get pairwise R^2


## Part 2

### Perform 2 sample MR using
- Inverse variance weighted approach (wald ratio with standard error estimated by delta method)
- ML approach
- Heterogeneity tests

### Sensitivity analysis
- Egger regression
- Weighted median function

### Plots
- Funnel plot
- Forest plot
- Scatter plots (slopes with and without intercept)



## To add:

- Allow SNPs to be chr_pos or rsid
